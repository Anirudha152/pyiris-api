# The Future of PyIris
A short collection of ideas and concepts I have planned for PyIris in the future upcoming updates. I'm pretty busy with life so theres no 
set date on when these goals will be fulfilled, could be finished in a duration of weeks to years. 

## Short Term Goals
- Port all the webcam based operations, over from using cv2 to just using PIL, because its stupid getting people to import a computer 
vision library for the sole purpose of watching people through their webcams [Added 4/26/2020]
- Implement a webcam streaming feature (!!!). [Added 4/26/2020] :white_check_mark: [done 7/18/2020]
- Fix some instability issues with the recv_all() network protocol. (rate limiting is not working) [Added 4/26/2020] :white_check_mark: [done 7/18/2020]
- Possibly implement a screen recording function as well. [Added 4/26/2020]
- Look into audio streaming/ recording if possible. [Added 4/26/2020]
- Possibly get scouts to provide more data upon connecting back [Added 4/26/2020]


## Long Term Goals
- Add communications encryption (Maybe AES, maybe RSA) encryption between scouts using the standard text data protocol [Added 4/26/2020]
- Add support for more scout bases (An HTTP base maybe could be possible, Discord base, Telegram base, Twitter Base, Reddit. I even have 
an absurd idea for scout communication using roblox will look into and do more research about this) [Added 4/26/2020]
- Continue to add more advanced features, I have a few more features I want to implement for the scouts relating to machine persistence, 
command and control functionality, credential exfiltration and even some social engineering elements. The ideas are vague so I need to 
sketch them out fully before moving them to short term. [Added 4/26/2020]
- Currently working on implementing a GUI/ web interface in collaboration with a close friend of mine (more like hes doing all the front 
end lol). Details are still hazy although the prototype is mostly finished I may need to ensure backend stability/ optimization before 
rolling out the release [Added 
4/26/2020]
- Figure out how to dynamically load python modules. Not sure if this is possible at all. If so, it may completely change the entire 
course of this project. Will do more research and look into it. [Added 4/26/2020]
