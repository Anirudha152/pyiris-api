# Contributing
When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via Github issues, email, or any other method with me before making a change.
You can contact me at 1010angusx@gmail.com or just make an issue whichever you want :)

# Contributions that I am currently accepting now
- Any addition or modification to the windows or linux control or startup components
- Any bug fixes with any libraries or modules present in the project
- Any cross platform scout payload encoders, base64, AES and XOR are already included, feel free to add more encoders I'm not too familiar with cryptography of payloads
- In the CHANGE_LOG.md file, log entry 0.7.2 is a yearly roadmap. None of the things there have been completed yet feel free to assist and work on any of those

# What to do after making changes in the code (Not necessary but at least tell me if you did this or not, if not tell me what changes you made)
- Open the source code of PyIris.py and increment the commented out version number accordingly based on [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (I kinda broke mine but Ill be reverting back to the orginial rules of semantic versioning soon after all the minor changes)
- Open the CHANGE_LOG.md file and input in whatever changes you made underneath an H1 header with the current version number. (Give a brief description, details and precise changes not needed)
- If your new component or change requires a third party library navigate to either setup/windows/requirements.txt or setup/linux/requirements.txt (depending on OS unless its cross platform) and add the new module with the exact version number
- Clear all python compiled files (.pyc), cred file (PyIris.cred) and generated payloads (/generated)
- Write in PEP8 pls
- Your done and now can push


Legit all you have to do is just message me and tell me if you wanna add something cool here. Im fine with anything really as long as it 
doesn't make major changes to the project
